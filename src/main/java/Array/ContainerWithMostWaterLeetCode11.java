package Array;

/**You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 Notice that you may not slant the container.

 Example 1:
 Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 Output: 49
 Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 Example 2:
 Input: height = [1,1]
 Output: 1

 Constraints:
 n == height.length
 2 <= n <= 105
 0 <= height[i] <= 104

 * Problem Understanding:

 * You need to find two lines that together with the x-axis forms a container that can hold the most water
 * The width is the distance between the two lines.
 * The height is limited by the shorter of the two lines:
 * The amount of water is width Ã— minimum height of the two lines

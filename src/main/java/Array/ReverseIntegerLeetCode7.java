     *             7. Reverse Integer" fails because it doesn't correctly handle cases where the reverse value overflows or underflows the range of a 32-bit signed integer. The Integer.MAX_VALUE check is applied incorrectlyâ€”it compares the reverse variable (which is an integer) directly against Integer.MAX_VALUE. However, the overflow occurs during the computation of reverse = reverse * 10 + reminder,
     *             so by the time you check it, the overflow has already occurred, and you cannot reliably detect it.
     *
     *             Why It Fails
     * Overflow or Underflow During Multiplication or Addition:
     *
     *
     * For a 32-bit signed integer:
     * Maximum value: 2,147,483,647
     * Minimum value: -2,147,483,648
     * If multiplying reverse by 10 or adding reminder causes the value to exceed this range, the behavior is undefined in Java due to integer overflow.
     * Logical Flaw in if (reverse > Integer.MAX_VALUE):
     *
     * You are comparing an int value (reverse) against Integer.MAX_VALUE. If reverse has already overflowed, it wraps around, and this comparison no longer works as expected.
     *
     * Explanation of Fixes*
     * Overflow Check Before Updating reverse:
     *
     * reverse > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10: Multiplying reverse by 10 would exceed the max limit.
     * (reverse == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && reminder > 7): Adding reminder would exceed the max limit (last digit of Integer.MAX_VALUE is 7).
     * Underflow Check:
     *
     * reverse < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10: Multiplying reverse by 10 would go below the min limit.
     * (reverse == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && reminder < -8): Adding reminder would go below the min limit (last digit of Integer.MIN_VALUE is -8).

1.  To findout 2D Array's column length/how many columns are present: arr[0].length;
2.  For Matrix related/2d array qus, writedown the matrix and then list down the matrix elemenet in terms of index.
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sum of diagonal:
for primary diagonal:
arr[0][0]
arr[1][1]
arr[2][2]

if you see the patern is arr[i][i]

For secondary diagonal:
arr[0][2]
arr[1][1]
arr[2][0]

if you see the patern is arr[i][n-1-i]

sum += arr[i][i] + arr[i][n-1-i];
for middle/intersect element: if length of matrix is even, mid is 0 (as for even case no intersect point comes;
 if matrix length is odd, mid[n/2][n/2];
 mid = n%2 ==0?0 : mid[n/2][n/2]
